# 3. Module Design Pattern

## Internal private scope in module pattern

Module pattern enables us to create a private scope for our code inside a function while providing controlled acccess to such a private scope through an interface. This interface can be in the form of a returned singleton object.

Example of internal private scoping inside a module:

```JavaScript
const mySingletonObj = () => {
    // private variables
    let name = "Sasan";
    let title = "Software Developer";

    // returning a singleton
    return {
        name: "Tom",

        // privileged method
        getOuterName: function() {
            return name;
        },

        // privileged method
        getInnerName: function() {
            return this.name;
        },

        // privileged method
        getTitle: function() {
            return this.title;
        }
    }
}();

console.log(mySingletonObj.name); // displays "Tom"
```

However, if we try to access the same property, using the method property on the intreface, a different value will be returned. Have a look at the following code snippet:

```JavaScript
console.log(mySingletonObj.getOuterName()); // displays "Sasan"
```

As you can see, the value returned from this method is the value for the ```name`` property from the outer scope of the interface, which is the scope of the ocntianer function. This can be rather confusing.

If the intent is to return the value for the name property which is defined inside the singleton object itself (the interface), we need to qualify the prperty using the ```this``` keyword.

We can add a second new method to our module:

```JavaScript
getInnerName: () => {return this.name;}
```

In this method, we specificallky qualify the ocntext for ```name``` using the ```this``` keyword, which references the context of the singleton object itself as opposed to the containing function. Thus, if we run the following code:

```JavaScript
console.log(mySingletonObj.getInnerName()); // displays "Tom"
```

The value assigned to ```name``` in the ocntext of the singleton object is returned. This is an important distinction to keep in mind.

## Creating loose coupling among modules

In a modular design, an application is often created using many modules. In order for these modules to work together, we need to create coupling among them, iwthout the modules being tightly dependent on each other.

We will start by creating our core application module and calling it ```ApplicationInitModule```. Usually, the very first step in running an application is to take care of the application's initialization tasks. Our ```ApplicationInitModule``` will be designed to do just that.

In the following code snippet, when ```ApplicationInitModule``` is started, it will in turn start all the registered modules and their initialization routines. this process will take care of the application's initialization routine as a whole.

```JavaScript
const ApplicationInitModule = (
    () => {
        const registeredModules = [];

        return {
            registerModule: function(module) {
                registeredModules.push(module);
            },
            getAppModulesCount: function() {
                return registeredModules.length;
            },
            removeRegisteredModule: function(index) {
                registeredModules.splice(index, 1);
            },
            initializeAllModules: function() {
                for (const module in registeredModules) {
                    registeredModules[module].initialize();
                }
            }
        }
    }
)();


const GlobalApp = (
    () => {
        const registerModule = ApplicationInitModule.registerModule;

        return {
            registerModule: registerModule
        }
    }
)();


const testModule1 = (
    () => {
        const self = {};
        const moduleName = "Module 1";

        self.initialize = function() {
            console.log("testmodule1 has been initialized!");
            console.log(`module name is ${moduleName}`);
        };

        (
            () => {
                GlobalApp.registerModule(self);
            }
        )();

        return {
            initialize: self.initialize,
            getName: function() {
                return moduleName;
            }
        }
    }
)();


const testModule2 = (
    () => {
        const moduleName = "Module 2";

        function initialize() {
            console.log("testmodule2 has been initialized");
        }

        return {
            initialize: initialize
        }
    }
)();

GlobalApp.registerModule(testModule2);

ApplicationInitModule.initializeAllModules();
```

### Application core module

The code starts by defining ```ApplicationInitModule``` as an application initializer module. The purpose of this module is to register all the available modules in the application (store them in an array) and then initialize them all (one at a time), when the application runs.

This module also provides an interface with some hooks for the external code to interact with. As you can see, there are methods to register a module, get the count of all the modules registered in the app for initialization, and remove a module from the list of registered modules; of course, there is also a method to initialize all modules that have been registered with the app.

### Application Mediator module

Our ```GlobalApp``` module also uses an IIFE to return a singleton object as the interface to the module. The whole purpose of this module is to act as a mediator (abstraction layer) between ```testModule1```, ```testModule2``` adn our core module ```ApplicationInitModule```.

We have designed the application this way so we can create a loose coupling between our core module and the other registered modules. As you can see, ```GlobalApp``` has been designed as a very thing layer.

This thin layer allows us to change our code module (```ApplicationInitModule```) as we please and even change its interface to the outside world, without affecting the other modules that rely on this module's functionality.

In our design, the only module which relies direclty on the ```ApplicationInitModule``` interface is our ```GlobalApp``` module. This means that, if there are any changes to the interface of ```AppliationInitModule```, we only need to make modificaitons to our thin mediate layer ```GlobalApp```. All the other modules in the application will be unaffected, as they still use the same thin layer interface provided by ```GlobalApp```.

### Application non-core modules

In our application implementation, we have created two simple modules that register themselves with the core module and really do nothing other than announcing to the world that they have been initialized.

### testModule1 implementation

In ```testModule1```, we have created an empty object called ```self```, which gets augmented with a method called ```initialize```. This is the method that will be called when our core module tries to initialize this module.

The registration of this module with the core module happens using an internal IIFE, which in turn calls our mediator module ```GlobalApp``` with a reference to the object ```self```. This is implemented as shown below:

```JavaScript
(
    () => {
        GlobalApp.registerdModule(self);
    }
)();
```

Of course, the ```GlobalApp.registerModule``` method is in fact a reference to the core module's method, ```ApplicationInitModule.registerModule```. However, ```testModule1``` does not know that and is only aware of the ```GlobalAppp``` provided interface, ```GlobalApp.registerModule```.

We have also used an IIFE to return an interface to this module, which is available through the ```testModule1``` variable.

Note that the interface provides two properties. One is a reference to the ```self.initialize``` method of the module and the other, ```getName```, simply returns the value of the encapsulated and hidden ```moduleName``` variable. Also note that ```moduleName``` is not a property on the ```self``` object. Instead, it is implemented as a containing function's property.

### testModule2 implementation

Our ```testModule2``` is implemented a little differently in comparison to ```testModule1```. As shown in the code, we have simply defined a function inside our module called ```initialize``` that is exposed to the external code indirectly through the interface returned from our IIFE for this module.

In our ```testModule2```, the ```moduleName``` variable is completely sealed from the outside world as there are no methods defined on the interface to provided access to this variable.

There is also no internal IIFE that registed the module with our core module, ```ApplicationInitModule```, thus we need to make a call outside of our module definition to achieve this task, as shown here:

```JavaScript
GlobalApp.registerModule(testModule2);
```

Notice that we have used our mediator module ```GlobalApp``` for this registration again and we are not directly calling the related method on the core module. This allows us to still preserver our loose coupling among the modules.

# 5. Module Augmentation

Module augmentaiton allows us to extend our modules without the need to change the original implementation. There are different techniques which can be used to implement module augmentation, and we will cover a couple of them in this chapter.

Module augmentation can be very useful when working on projects that have many contributors to the code base. This type of projects usually require us to extend our module by adding new code and functionality to what has been already developed by other developers.

## Implementing module augmentation 

Imagine that we have a module called ```ModuleA``` and, as a developer, you want to add more functionality to this module. However, for some reason, you decide to implement this new functionality in a compeltely separate module and then dynamically augment the original module with all the data and capabilities of this new module. You can achieve this as shown here:

```JavaScript
const moduleA = (coreModule) => {
    let someData = "some data";

    coreModule.someMethod = () => {
        return someData;
    };

    return coreModule;
}(moduleA);
```

## Loose agumentation of modules

When we try to enhance a module using the agumentation technique previously discussed, we pass a reference of the module to another part of our code which is responsible for doing the augmentation work.

How can we add functionality to an object that has not been loaded or created yet ?

The answer to this question becomes very important when our modules ( files ) are loaded in an asynchronous fashion, and we have no way of making sure that our original module is loaded before the augmentation code that enhances the modules.

One of the beautiful and powerful aspects of JavaScript is its ability to add properties to objects dynamically, at any time during code exeuction. This allows us to add functionality or modify our original module's implementation even before the module is loaded, as long as we provide a temporary object in the absence of the module. This temporary object will be added to the original module after the module is loaded ( or more accurately, it becomes one with the original module ).

If it sounds complicated, it really is simpler than you think. Let's revisit our previous augmentin code and examing it a little closer:

```JavaScript
((coreModule) => {
    coreModule.someText = "this is a test for module augmentation;
    coreModule.getExtendedModuleMsg = () => {
        console.log(coreModule.someText);
    }

    return coreModule;
})(someCoreModule);
```

I mentioned that for the augmentation to work properly, we needed to load this code, which is responsible for augmenting the ```someCoreModule``` module after the original module is loaded. Otherwise, a code execution error will be thrown. While that remains true, what if we compensate for when ```someCoreModule``` does not yet exist in the application by using an empty object ?

As you probably know, we can call a function as follows:

```JavaScript
someFunc(someParameter || someOtherParameter);
```

When we do this, we are telling the JavaScript interpreter to pass ```someParameter``` when calling ```someFunc```, if it has a value; and if not, pass ```someOtherParameter``` to the function. This is how the ```||``` operator works in the preceding code snippet.

We can use the same technique and pass an empty object to our anonymous function, as follows:

```JavaScript
(someCoreModule || {});
```

We tell the interpreter to pass a reference of our ```someCoreModule``` object when calling the function, if the object exists, or pass a reference of an empty object which will replace our original module for the time being.

## Tight augmentation of modules

Tight augmentation is used for adding properties ( functionality ) to our modules when we do want to enforce a set order of file loading and code exeuction, and therefore it is **less flexible**. This type of augmentation is usually used when we need to make sure that a certain property from the original module is available for our augmenting code.

Consider our augmenting code for ```someCoreModule``` module from the previous seciton, hwne loose augmentation was being used. As mentioned previously, since we are passing a reference to ```someCoreModule``` or an empty anonymous object into our IIFE, we can load our original module and our augmenting code in any order that we like.

This was shown as follows:

```JavaScript
const someCoreModule = ((coreModule) => {
    coreModule.someText = "this is a test for loose module augmentation";
    coreModule.getExtendedModuleMsg = () => {
        console.log(coreModule.someText);
    }
    
    return coreModule;
})(someCoreModule || {});
```

However, this also means that if we wanted to override one of the original module's properties, depending on what code gets loaded and exeucted first ( the original module or the augmenting code ), our "override" might be overridden by another piece of code, unintentionally and unexpectedly.

To understand this better, think of a file ```module_3.js``` and add the following code to it:

```JavaScript
((coreModule) => {
    coreModule.someText = "this is a test for overriding module properties with loose augmentation";
    coreModule.getExtendedModuleMsg = () => {
        console.log(coreModule.someText);
    }

    return coreModule;
})(someCoreModule || {});
```

Also, let's laod this file in our application as follows:

```HTML
<script type="text/javascript" async src="js/module_3.js></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/module_2.js></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/module_1.js></script>
```

Here we are loading two files (```module_2.js``` and ```module_3.js```), which augment our original module. ```module_2.js``` is being loaded before ```module_1.js``` but ```module_3.js``` can be loaded in any order since we are using the ```async``` property on the ```<script>``` tag for this file. This property tells the browser to load the file in any order that it can.

Both of these augmenting codes add the same property, ```coreModule.someText```, to the original module. However, depending on which code is laoded and executed first, only one of two pieces of text will be printed in the console.

We can test this by executing the following code:

```JavaScript
coreModule.getExtendedModuleMsg();
```

The console will display one of the following:

* **this is a test for loose module augmentation** ( from ```module_2.js``` )
* **this is a test for overriding module properties with loose augmentation** ( from ```module_3.js``` )

Keep in mind that in this scenario, we have no control over which one of the strings will be the value of the ```coreModule.someText``` property, after all the code execution is completed. This is because we don't know which augmenter code will be loaded and executed last. This also means that by using loose augmentation technique and asynchoronous loading, augmenter code precedence is determined dynamically at runtime and not necesseerarily in the order that we think or desire.

On suhc basis, if our intent was that the value of ```coreModule.someText``` should be overridden by the code in ```module_3.js```, then we culd not be sure of such an override taking place.

**Tight augmentation, on the other hand, guarantees the order of code exectuion and tehrefore how our modules get augmented.** By using this technique, we can be sure that when a module property is overridden, it will be in the order that we intended and the result will be as expected.

This guarantee is provided by the fact that we don't have any choice but to load our modoule and its augmenting code in the correct order, otherwise a code execution error will be generated.

Let's examing this by modifying the code in our ```module_3.js``` as follows:

```JavaScript
const someCoreModule = ((coreModule) => {
    if(!coreModule) {
        console.error("coreModule was not found to be augmented!");
        return false;
    }

    coreModule.someText = "this is a test for overriding module properties with loose augmentation";
    coreModule.getExtendedModuleMsg = () => {
        console.log(coreModule.someText);
    }

    return coreModule;
})(someCoreModule);
```

A consideration that needs to be taken when it comes to tight augmentation is that you dont really need to create a global variable to store the returned value from the augmenting code that implements the tight augmentation technique.
This is so since this type of augmentation can only take place if the module already exists in the global context. 
In fact, the following code will work just as well as the previous version:

```JavaScript
((coreModule) => {
    if(!coreModule) {
        console.error("coreModule was not found to be augmented!");
        return false;
    }

    coreModule.someText = "this is a test for overriding module properties with loose augmentation";
    coreModule.getExtendedModuleMsg = () => {
        console.log(coreModule.someText);
    }

    return coreModule;
})(someCoreModule);
```

## Module loading techniques

When it comes to loading scripts in an HTML file, there are 3 possibilities:

***1. Normal***
***2. Async***
***3. Defer***

![Normal Loading](ScreenshotsForNotes/NormalLoading.PNG)

Normal loading looks like this:

```HTML
<script src="scripts/test.js"></script>
```

***HTML is parsed until we find a script file. We stop the parsing, load the file, run it and then continue with the parsing.***

![Async Loading](ScreenshotsForNotes/AsyncLoading.PNG)

Async loading looks like this:

```HTML
<script async src="scripts/test.js"></script>
```

***We parse the HTML file until we find a script file. We continue parsing until the file is loaded and then stop the parsing to run it. Afterwards, we continue parsing.***

![Defer Loading](ScreenshotsForNotes/DeferLoading.PNG)

Defered loading looks like this:

```HTML
<script defer src="scripts/test.js"></script>
```

***We parse the HTML file until we get to a script file. We continue parsing and while parsing we load the file. After we are done with parsing the file we run it.***

# 6. Cloning, Inheritance and Submodules

## Using the assingment operator for copying objects

When we are suing primitve types in JavaScript, we can easily use the assignment operator to copy the value of one variable to another, as shown:

```JavaScript
let a = 5;
let b = a;
```

In the preceding code, we are simply assigning the value of one variable to another variable, and there is no mystery here, but how would that work for two objects?

Let's put that to the test as follows:

```JavaScript
let a = {
    testValue: 5
};

let b = a;

a.newValue = 10;
console.log(b.newValue); // 10
```

Here, we are assigning ```a``` to ```b``` using the assignment operator, which might appear as creating a new object based on another object.

However, as you can see, when we create a new property for ```a```, even after the assignment of ```a``` to ```b``` has taken place, the new property is available to ```b``` as well.

The reason is that when we use the assignment operator toa ssign the value of a variable which holds a reference to an object to another variable, we are in fact assigning the memory address of the object to another variable. This results in both variables referencing the same object. So, in the code above, both ```a``` and ```b``` are referencing the same object.

## Shallow cloning and deep cloning

***Shallow cloning*** copies all the top-level properties of the original object, but if this object contains other reference types, only the *references* of these reference types are copied to the newly created clone, as opposed to the actual reference types. This type of cloning is used when we want to have separate copies of the primitve types in the new object but we want the original boject and the newly cloned object to share the same reference types.

***Deep cloning*** on the other hand, copies all the primitive type properties of the original object into the new object as well as making new copies of all the reference types of the original object in the new object.

The important distinction is that true copies of the reference types are created in the new object and not just the references ( the memory addresses ) of the reference types. This type of cloning is desirable if we want to have two distinct objects with no ties between them of any kind. Deep cloning is generally considered slower than shallow cloning and consumes more resources.

# 9. Modular Application Design and Testing

## Different types of automated tests

There are many different types of automated tests, but we will consider and talk about only three categories of such tests as listed here:

* Unit testing
* Integration testing
* End to end testing

## Unit testing

Unit tests are usually diesnged to test the functionality of individual pieces of our code in isolation. This usually means testing our functions and methods, one at a time, to make sure they do exactly what is expected of them.

We usually write such tests in a manner that can verify the functionality of our methods and individual pieces of our code in various scenarios.

There are two main styles of writing unit tests; **Test Driven Development(TDD)** and **Behavioral Driven Development(BDD)**.

## TDD unit tests

TDD unit testing is mostly used to test the implementation of our code. This is done by testing the actual result that a method produces against what is expected.

The TDD process can be thought of as the following loop, if we write our tests before the code implementation:

1. Write a unit test
2. Run the test and expect it to fail
3. Write the code required to make the test pass
4. Run the test again to make sure the test passes
5. Re-factor the code if needed
6. Start from the first step again

As you can see, TDD is meant to be implemented from the beginning of the project and to continue through the project's life cycle.

## BDD unit tests

This style of testing is focused on the expected behavior of our code and not necessarily the implementation of it.

When we use BDD style of writing unit tests, we write our assertions in a way that can be read like a natural sentence.

For instance a test should read as "returns a value that is incremented by 1 from the previous value".

BDD can also follow the same process loop shown in the TDD section.

## TDD versus BDD

Imagine that we have a function which is a counter, and when it is called for the first time, it will return the value 1 and every time after taht, it will return the previous counter value plus 1.

The TDD style of writing unit tests, we test that our function is initialized with the default value ( start value ) of zero, since that is tied with the very first time that the function is called.

This detail ( that the start value is 0 ) is an implementation aspect and TDD style of writing tests checks for such implementation details. It also means that if we decide the default value ( start value ) in our counter function should change to 2, our test case also needs to change accordingly.

In BDD style of writing unit tests, we don't check to see what the returned value is when the function is called for the very first time. We only check to see that every time the function is called the counter has been incremented by 1. This means that if we change the start value of the function at some later time, it has no effect on the expected behavior of the function. Our function should always increment the previous value by 1, regardless of the starting value.

The difference between TDD and BDD is very sbutle but important to keep in mind.

## Test coverage

It is ideal to write enough unit tests to achieve 100 percent test coverage for our code. However, in reality, it is not always possible to write unit tests for every aspect of the code.

Of course, the more tests we write, the better the code quality we can expect, but time lines also need to be kept in mind for every project. In reality, we do not always have sufficient time to achieve the full coverage of our code base with unit tests. However, we should keep in mind that in the long run, we save more time on finding and fixing bugs when we have more code coverage with our tests.

## Integration testing

This type of testing is mainly focused on mkaing sure that different pieces of the application can work together properly.

When different methods and modules are involved to provide a certain functionality, we want to test and see if the deisred functionality has been achieved by the sum of collaboration among such pieces.

An example could be that one function reads a string from a file and passes it to another function, which creates an array based on the comma delimiter in the string. Our integration test will make sure that the correct array was produced based on these two functions working together to read and process the string.

## End to end testing

These tests usually check the flow of the application's functionality from the start to finish to make sure that the application as a whole is working properly and as intended.

For instance, to test the correct behavior of the application based on the form submission on a page, we can submit the form value to the server using an AJAX call, get the results from the server and then refresh the content area of the application based on the returned values. By examining the final result, we can be sure that our application behaves as expected.

***End to end*** ( also known as ***E2E*** ) testing is usually done after our unit tests and integration tests have passed.

# 10. Enterprise Grade Modular Design, AMD, CommonJS and ES6 Modules

## Introducting Asynchronous Module Definition

**Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)** format for creating modules in JavaScript, is targeted for use in browsers. This format proposes a particular way for defining modules so that modules and their dependencies can be loaded into the browser asynchronously.

There are two key methods that you need to use when creating and consuming AMD modules, these are ```define``` and ```require``` methods.

The idea is that we create a mdoule using the global ```define``` method and then we can import that module in other parts of the code ( other modules ) using the global ```require``` method.

#### Defining modules using AMD format

Here is how a module can be defined in AMD format:

```JavaScript
define("moduleOneId", ["dependency"], (dependency) => {
    return {
        sayHi: () => {
            console.log("Hello");
        }
    }
});
```

The first argument, ```moduleOneId```, is an optional parameter which assigns and ID to the module. Most of the time, we do not use this argument and other than some edge cases or when a non-MAD concatenation tool is being used to bundle our code, we leave it empty.

The second argument to ```define``` function is an array of dependencies, which tells the AMD mdoule loader what modules ( files ) need to be loaded before executing the callback funciton. Of course, the third argument passed to ```define``` method is the callback function.

Notice that we are returning an object from this callback function. This object is the module that we are defining. In AMD format, the callback function can also return constructors and functions.

### Importing AMD modules

To use the module that we have defined in the preceding code, we can import it by using the global ```require``` function. 

Consider the following:

```JavaScript
require(["moduleOneId"], (moduleOne) => {
    moduleOne.sayHi();
});
```

Here, we are asking the AMD module loader to load the dependency ```moduleOneId``` before executing the callback function.

Note that we could also use the path to our dependency instead of using the related ID. For instance, we would write the preceding code snippet as follows:

```JavaScript
require(["folderPath/moduleOne.js"], (moduleOne) => {
    moduleOne.sayHi();
});
```

AMD format provides great flexibility in defining and loading our modules. It also eliminates the need for creating global variables to define the modules. AMD-compatbile script loaders also often provide the capability to lazy-load our mdoules, if needed.

There are many web development tools ( libraries ) that support AMD format, but the most popular ones are ```RequireJS``` and ```curl.js```.

## CommonJS

As with AMD format, CommonJS ( also known as CJS ) is another format which defines JavaScript modules as objects that can be amde available to any dependent code. CJS modules can only define objects, as opposed to AMD modules, which can define constructors and functions too.

Unlike AMD format, which takes a browser-first approach, CommonJS takes a server-first approach. It also covers a broader set of concerns which are server-realted, suhc as io, file system and alike.

Many developers use AMD format for browser-targeted modules and CommonJS for server-side targeted modules. However, you could use CJS format for browsers modules as well.

Some of the tools that support CJS for the browsers are ```curl.js``` and ```SproutCore```.

#### Implementing a CommonJS module

Imagine that we have a file called ```moduleOne.js```. From inside this file, we can export a CJS module like so:

```JavaScript
exports.someFunc = () => {
    return console.log("I am some function");
}
```

Here, ```exports``` is a global variable and contains the object which the module is making available to other modules that wish to consume it.

On the other hand, imagine that we have another module in ```moduleTwo.js``` file, which resides in the same directory as ```moduleOne.js```

```moduleTwo.js``` can import ```moduleOne``` and consume it like so:

```JavaScript
const module = require("./defineModule");
module.someFunction();
```

## ES6 Modules

With ES6 modules, the ```import``` and ```export``` statements were introduced.

#### ```Export```

In order to export variables, functions, classes, etc. from a module you must use the ```export``` statement.
There are two types of exports:

* Named exports ( none or many )
* Default exports ( none or one )

The difference between named and defualt exports can only be seen when you import.

Here is the general syntax for ```export```:

```JavaScript
// Exporting individual features
export let name1, name2, …, nameN; // also var, const
export let name1 = …, name2 = …, …, nameN; // also var, const
export function functionName(){...}
export class ClassName {...}

// Export list
export { name1, name2, …, nameN };

// Renaming exports
export { variable1 as name1, variable2 as name2, …, nameN };

// Exporting destructured assignments with renaming
export const { name1, name2: bar } = o;

// Default exports
export default expression;
export default function (…) { … } // also class, function*
export default function name1(…) { … } // also class, function*
export { name1 as default, … };

// Aggregating modules
export * from …; // does not set the default export
export * as name1 from …; // ECMAScript® 2O20
export { name1, name2, …, nameN } from …;
export { import1 as name1, import2 as name2, …, nameN } from …;
export { default, … } from …;
```

You can change the name of the exports. You can export when you are constructing variables, classes, etc. or export them later.

You can export things from other modules, including default values:

```JavaScript
export { default } from './module.js';
```

In this way, I have exported the default export from another module inside my module. This can be useful when you are trying to build one big module that is binding all the other modules.


#### ```Import```

You can import the exported things using ```import```. Just like with ```export```, you can import default values, you can change the name of the things that you are trying to import, you can import everything ( ```*``` ) under a certain name, etc.

This is the syntax for ```import```:

```JavaScript
import defaultExport from "module-name";
import * as name from "module-name";
import { export1 } from "module-name";
import { export1 as alias1 } from "module-name";
import { export1 , export2 } from "module-name";
import { export1 , export2 as alias2 , [...] } from "module-name";
import defaultExport, { export1 [ , [...] ] } from "module-name";
import defaultExport, * as name from "module-name";
import "module-name";
var promise = import("module-name");
```

When you are importing default values, you can change the name of those values without using ```as```:

```JavaScript
import SomeClass from './module.js';
// inside module.js: export default class User { ... }

const user = new SomeClass('nameTest', 18);
```

You can also import everything under a certain name, so you will have a namespace:

```JavaScript
import * as namespace from './module.js';

console.log(namespace.a);
console.log(namespace.b);
```
